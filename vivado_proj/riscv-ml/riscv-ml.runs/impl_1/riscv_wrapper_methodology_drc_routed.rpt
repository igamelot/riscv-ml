TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock riscv_i/RocketChip/jtag_tck is created on an inappropriate pin riscv_i/RocketChip/jtag_tck. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock riscv_i/RocketChip/jtag_tck is defined downstream of clock riscv_i/BSCAN/inst/bs_switch/inst/BSCAN_SWITCH.N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_inst/SERIES7_BSCAN.bscan_inst/TCK and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks riscv_i/BSCAN/inst/bs_switch/inst/BSCAN_SWITCH.N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_inst/SERIES7_BSCAN.bscan_inst/TCK] -to [get_clocks riscv_i/RocketChip/jtag_tck]

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT riscv_i/JTAG/inst/tck_buf_1.tck_buf_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources.

ULMTCS-1#1 Warning
Control Sets use limits recommend reduction  
This design uses 1300 control sets (vs. available limit of 15850, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 7.5 percent. This is at a level where reduction is RECOMMENDED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '15' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

With such constraint, it is recommended to have a DONT_TOUCH or KEEP_HIERARCHY on the hierarchical module to avoid the risk of pin names changing during synthesis.
